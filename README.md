# Dice Roll Game
 A javascript game in which users roll a dice to collect points. The game rolls a random dice, which is then added to the Round score (a temporary collection of points) and the user is free to roll as many times as they like and ramp up points -- however, if they roll a 1, then all of their Round score is lost. Otherwise they can Commit their points to their Score by clicking the arrow/box button. If they roll 1 or Commit, then it's the other player's turn. The first player to get 100 points wins.

This game utilizes DRY code and a lot of DOM manipulation.
